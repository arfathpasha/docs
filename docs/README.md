# Bee

> Bioinformatics operations at scale.

## What is it

Bee is a framework to conduct bioinformatics operations at scale. It addresses the need of entities such as research labs, sequencing centers, bioinformatics cores, molecular diagnostic enterprises and pharmaceuticals to manage their genomics capital and maximize the utilization of Next Generation Sequencing assets by providing them with a modular, opensource, plug-and-play infrastructure.

## Infrastructure

Bee is composed of an extendable, performant and well documented backend and RESTful API, a lightweight Command Line Utility used to manage NGS data and deploy bioinformatics applications at scale, and a intuitive web application that enables dynamic interrogations across all the NGS capital. This 'microservice' approach results in a collection of loosely coupled services with explicit and lightweight functions, making the infrastructure much more accessible, testable and approachable for the community.

## Data model

Bee models a NGS data generation process where sequencing *Experiments* such as Whole Genome Sequencing are performed on *Samples* collected from different *Individuals*. Bee's normalization approach reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity. The concept of cohorts, where multiple *Experiments* are grouped and analyzed together, is fundamental to Bee and is well supported. Bee also tracks and executes *Assembly* aware *Bioinformatics Applications* making sure that results are a function of the reference genome. Instances of these applications are also tracked and referred as *Analyses*.

## What bee is not

* Bee is not a workflow execution engine such as [toil] or [bpipe], instead an platform that trigger these engines and track their results

* Bee is not a platform as a service (PAAS) provider such as [DNA nexus], [Seven Briges] or [Fire Cloud], instead an information system that could potentially feed in metadata and data to these services.

* Bee is not a workflow engine, instead the *Bioinformatics Applications* in bee only define mata-data driven validation and logic to build commands to trigger pipelines written in any language.
