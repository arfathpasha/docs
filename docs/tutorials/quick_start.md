# Quick Start

This tutorial will walk you through installation, data import and pipelines executions.

<!-- - You will learn to:
    - [ ] Install system locally
    - [ ] Create super user -->

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Compose] for building and running the application.
- [Virtualenvwrapper] and `python>=3.6` for the Command Line Interface.

## Installation

First install [cookiecutter] and bootstrap your project:

```bash
# cookiecutter is an utility that creates projects from templates
pip install cookiecutter

# now we bootstrap from bee's cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/leukgen/cookiecutter-bee
```

Lets proceed to build and run the application:

```bash
cd my_project               # go to your project directory
docker-compose build        # build with docker-compose
docker-compose up           # now run the application
```

You will need to create a new user before you can access the system:

```bash
# run on a separate terminal window from the project directory
docker-compose run --rm django python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Now visit your browser at http://localhost:8000/ and log in!

?> cookiecutter-bee is a proud fork of [cookiecutter-django]! Many topics from their [guide] are relevant to your project.

## Create project

## Add samples

## Import data

> **Ad:** Tired of typing long commands? Install [alie] and bring aliases to the future!

Lets proceed to import data for the samples we just created. First install the client:

```bash
mkvirtualenv -p python3 my_project     # optional but strongly recommended
pip3 install bee-cli                   # install bee client
```

?> **Note:** use `workon` to activate a virtual environment, deactivate with `deactivate`.

Now download the test data, import it and retrieve paths from API:

```bash
# TODO: download test data and reference genome
curl

# import data for test samples
bee import_data \
    -di quick_start_data               `# provide data location ` \
    -fi research_id__startswith quick  `# filter samples to be imported ` \
    -id research_id                    `# match files with experiment's research id`

# retrieve new data locations from api
bee get_sequencing_data -fi research_id__startswith quick
```

Note that data is stored in your home directory, learn about [CLI advanced configuration] to customize functionality.

## Run alignment and pipelines

## Visualize results

?> You can type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop the application.

?> Ready for **production**? learn more about [deployment].
